# Alchemia üß™‚ú®

**Alchemia** is a web application that leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to predict key molecular properties from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. It provides chemists, researchers, and students with quick insights into the physicochemical characteristics of chemical compounds.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Molecular Property Prediction:** Enter a SMILES string and get predictions for:
    *   Canonical SMILES
    *   Molecular Formula
    *   Molecular Weight (g/mol)
    *   LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)
    *   Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors
    *   Number of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors
    *   Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA in √Ö¬≤)
    *   Number of Rotatable Bonds
    *   Formal Charge
*   **SMILES Input:**
    *   Directly type or paste a SMILES string.
    *   Upload a SMILES string from a `.smi` or `.txt` file.
*   **Responsive Design:** User-friendly interface that works on various screen sizes.
*   **Clear Visualizations:** Predicted properties are displayed in an easy-to-read card format.
*   **Loading & Error States:** Provides feedback during API calls and displays clear error messages.
*   **Dark Theme:** Aesthetically pleasing, chemistry-inspired dark theme.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`) via `@google/genai` SDK
*   **Module Loading:** ES Modules with `importmap` for browser-native module resolution.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser that supports ES Modules and `importmap`.
*   A Google Gemini API Key.

### Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional - if running locally from source):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd alchemia
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application expects the Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
    *   **For local development (if serving files with a local server that supports environment variables):**
        Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (if your local server setup supports it, like `vite` or a custom Node.js server) and add your API key:
        ```
        API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
        **Important:** Ensure this `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to prevent committing your API key.
    *   **For static deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel):**
        You will need to configure the `API_KEY` as an environment variable in your deployment platform's settings. The `index.html` and `geminiService.ts` are set up to use `process.env.API_KEY`. For static sites served directly, this `process.env` object won't be populated by a Node.js environment.
        In a purely static client-side deployment without a build step or server-side rendering, directly accessing `process.env.API_KEY` as coded will not work. The application code implies a build environment where `process.env.API_KEY` would be replaced or made available. If you are just opening `index.html` in the browser, you would need to manually replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your actual key ( **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION OR PUBLIC REPOSITORIES**). A more secure approach for client-side only apps is often to proxy requests through a backend or use a build tool to inject the key safely.
        *Given the current setup, the easiest way to test locally is to modify `services/geminiService.ts` temporarily if you are just opening `index.html` directly:*
        ```typescript
        // In services/geminiService.ts - FOR LOCAL TESTING ONLY, DO NOT COMMIT
        // const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
        const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE" });
        ```
        **Remember to revert this change before committing or deploying publicly.**

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. If you have a local web server (like VS Code's Live Server extension or Python's `http.server`), serving the project directory can provide a more robust experience, especially for handling module paths.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Enter SMILES String:**
    *   Type or paste a valid SMILES string into the input field (e.g., `CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O` for Aspirin).
    *   Alternatively, click the "Upload File" button to select a `.smi` or `.txt` file containing a SMILES string. The input field will be populated with the file's content.
2.  **Reveal Properties:**
    *   Click the "Reveal Properties" button.
3.  **View Results:**
    *   The application will query the Gemini API.
    *   A loading indicator will appear while the request is in progress.
    *   Once the prediction is complete, the molecular properties will be displayed in cards.
    *   If an error occurs (e.g., invalid SMILES, API key issue), an error message will be shown.
